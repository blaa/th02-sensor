TH02 HOPERF sensor interface for RaspberryPI
--------------------------------------------

I bought the sensor and found some code on github which... wasn't stable
enough. Using docs and i²c spec I did complete rewrite of the code.

I don't like the bit-banging approach to the I²C, but it works fast enough.
